<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>

This app is for the allocation of students to projects. It is an implementation of Abraham et al's (2007) SPA-student algorithm:

The algorithm assigns students to projects, given preferences of students for projects, the offerings of projects by lecturers, preferences of lecturers for students, and respecting limits on lecturer and project loads.

<h3>How to get started</h3>

Read the instructions under the "Lecturers", "Projects", and "Students" tabs to learn how your three input files must be formatted. Then upload the three required files under their respective tabs. Once these files are uploaded and checked, the algorithm will produce output that can be found under the "Allocation" tab.
