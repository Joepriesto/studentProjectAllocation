<p>

All files should be plain text files. Information in each file is given in rows, one for each lecturer, project, or student (depending on the file).

<p>

The items in a row of a file are separated by spaces or tabs(so remember <b>not to include spaces or tabs</b> in any of your IDs).

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/richarddmorey/studentProjectAllocation/blob/master/R/studentAllocation/inst/examples/original/projects.txt" target="_blank">Example projects file &#11157;</a>

<p>

Each row of the projects file defines the parameters of a project. There are three main pieces of information per project:

<p>

<ol>
	<li>Project ID (character string, no spaces)</li>
	<li>Project capacity (integer)
	<li>Lecturer ID (character string, no spaces) indicating which lecturer offers the project</li>
</ol>

<p>

Each row should define a unique project (no duplicate IDs across rows) and all lecturer IDs should correspond to a row of the lecturers file.

<p>

The projects file will have three columns in every row.

<h4>Example rows</h4>

<pre>
knot_theory 3 CHEN<br/>
prime_numbers 2 CHEN<br/>
real_analysis 4 WILLIAMS
</pre>

The example above defines three projects, two of which are offered by CHEN and one of which is offered by WILLIAMS.
