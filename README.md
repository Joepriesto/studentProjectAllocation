An implementation of Abraham et al's (2007) algorithm for allocation of student projects. See Abraham et al (2007): 

[Abraham, D.J., Irving, R.W., and Manlove, D.M. (2007) Two algorithms for the student-project allocation problem. Journal of Discrete Algorithms, 5(1), pp. 73-90. (doi:10.1016/j.jda.2006.03.006)](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3439/)

This code assigns students to projects according to the SPA-student algorithm.
